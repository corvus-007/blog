            <p>Stefan A. Halper, the FBI source who assisted the Russia investigation and is at the center of a standoff between congressional Republicans and the Justice Department, is a well-connected veteran of past GOP administrations who convened senior intelligence officials for seminars at the University of Cambridge in England.</p>

            <p>In the summer and fall of 2016, Halper, then an emeritus professor at Cambridge, contacted three Trump campaign advisers for brief talks and meetings that largely centered on foreign policy, The Washington Post reported last week.</p>

            <p>The Post had previously confirmed Halper’s identity, but did not report his name following warnings from U.S. intelligence officials that exposing him could endanger him or his contacts. Now that he has been identified as the FBI’s informant by multiple news organizations, including the Wall Street Journal, New York magazine and Axios, The Post has decided to publish his name.</p>

            <p>Halper, 73, declined to add-comment. The FBI declined to add-comment.</p>

            <h2>Tomorrow is a new day</h2>

            <p>Halper’s contacts with Trump advisers around the start of the FBI’s counterintelligence have come under scrutiny in recent weeks by House allies of President Donald Trump. Late last month, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., issued a subpoena to the Justice Department requesting all documents related to the FBI informant.</p>

            <p>In recent days, Trump has seized on the reports about Halper’s role in the Russia probe, suggesting in tweets that the FBI improperly spied on his campaign. There is no evidence to suggest Halper was inserted into the Trump campaign, but he did engage in a pattern of seeking out and meeting three Trump advisers.</p>

            <p>On Monday, the conflict was defused – at least temporarily – with the announcement that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly plans to convene a meeting between top law enforcement officials and GOP congressional leaders to “review highly classified and other information” the lawmakers have requested about the source.</p>

            <p>Halper’s connections to the intelligence world have been present throughout his career and at Cambridge, where he ran an intelligence seminar that brought together intelligence officials of past and present.</p>

            <h3>Tomorrow is a new day</h3>

            <p>In 2014, Halper, along with Richard Dearlove, the former head of Britain’s foreign intelligence service, sponsored a meeting of the seminar that drew then-Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Michael Flynn, who would go on to serve as Trump’s first national security adviser.</p>

            <p>Halper later worked for Sen. William Roth, R-Del., before joining the George H.W. Bush campaign in 1980 as national policy development director and then working for the Reagan-Bush campaign as national director of policy coordination. In the Reagan administration, he served as deputy assistant secretary of state for politico-military affairs, according to his biography.</p>
